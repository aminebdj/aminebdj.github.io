description: 'One recent study [4] shows the importance of local parts
localization and parts alignment in enhancing the robust-
ness against pose variation, and improving the generaliz-
ability of the model when trained with optimal order of
fine-grained local parts. In their architecture, the parts from
a given image are optimally arranged by maximizing the
similarity between a correlation matrix of a reference set of
parts, and the one generated from the input parts following
all possible permutations.
Our approach, offers an end-
to-end trainable attention-based parts alignment module,
where we replace the graph-matching component used in
it with a self-attention mechanism. The attention module
is able to learn the optimal arrangement of parts while at-
tending to each other, before contributing to the global loss.'
